## This place for my Jquery and Jquery UI practices with examples
### Many of the examples here are derived/sourced/tweaked from [Javascript&Jquery:the missing manual by David Sawyer McFarland](https://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-jQuery-Missing-Manual-Manuals/dp/1491947071/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1499441094&sr=8-3&keywords=javascript+and+jquery)

### Each folders contain some useful Jquery/Jquery UI animations, effects, techniques for web development (Frontend mostly)! 

#### Thank you all! -Jae-
